Human Detection and Action Recognition are rapidly evolving areas in computer vision with key
applications in intelligent vehicles, surveillance, and advanced robotics. The objective of this
paper is to provide an inspection of several current state-of-the-art human detection and action
recognition systems from both methodological and implementation perspectives, including human
detection: Haar/AdaBoost\cite{haar}, HOG/linSVM\cite{DT2005}, as well as
Action Recognition:STIP/SVM\cite{stip}. In human detection, implementations are performed on
an extensive data set provided by Daimler as well as videos captured through campus environment. 
While in action recognition this paper firstly evaluates automatic annotation methods using scripts to
handle the limitation of video data set, then uses the retrieved action samples for visual learning
and recognition. Systems considered in this paper show promising results in application-specific scenario.
